"Generate a pixel art video game character design of a futuristic AI rapper representing Gemini 2.5. The character should be rendered in a highly detailed, 16-bit to 32-bit pixel style, featuring the distinct colors of the Google/Gemini brand (blues, greens, yellows, and reds, with a focus on neon accents). The character must be posed actively rapping into a microphone, looking dynamic and confident. The entire image should have a pure white background."
